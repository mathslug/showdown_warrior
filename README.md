## setup

* git clone this repository and cd into it

* save showdown credentials in `./data/login.txt` as:

```
username
password
```

* recommended: activate a virtualenv. I use poetry.

* `poetry install`

* `poetry run python start_warrior.py`

* you're done, go battle it on showdown

* control-c to stop it

* tinker with `thinker.py`

* repeat from `python start_warrior.py`, etc.
